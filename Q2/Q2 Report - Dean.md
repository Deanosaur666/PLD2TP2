# My computer

My personal computer is a Lenovo ThinkCentre I bought for $75 on eBay. It's running the Linux Mint operating system. When running `lscpu`, the first few lines read:

```
Architecture:             x86_64
  CPU op-mode(s):         32-bit, 64-bit
  Address sizes:          39 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
  Byte Order:             Little Endian
CPU(s):                   4
  On-line CPU(s) list:    0-3
```

My computer has 4 CPUs.
